- Use Redux Toolkit for all state management
- Create feature-based slices, not platform-based
- Use createSlice for reducers and actions
- Use createAsyncThunk for async operations
- Use createSelector for memoized selectors
- Keep Redux state normalized and flat
- Use Immer for immutable updates (built into Redux Toolkit)
- Avoid putting non-serializable data in Redux state
- Use Redux DevTools for debugging
- Implement proper error handling in Redux actions
- Store sensitive data securely, not in Redux state
- Use typed Redux hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector)
