- Use React.FC for functional components with props
- Utilize Redux for state management instead of useState for global state
- Use useState only for local component state
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic
- Utilize TypeScript's strict mode
- Use Redux Toolkit's createSlice for reducers and actions
- Use createAsyncThunk for async operations
- Use createSelector for memoized selectors
- Implement proper Redux TypeScript types
